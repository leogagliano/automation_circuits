# Project Description

## Logic
1. The system is activated by a single pulse on the non-retentive input [ACIONA_10].
2. Two sequences are available: (ABAB or ABBA), which can be selected by switching the retentive input [ABAB_OFF].
   - When [ABAB_OFF] isn't activated, the sequence ABAB  will be executed by pulsing [ACIONA_10].
   - When [ABAB_OFF] is activated, the sequence ABBA will be executed by pulsing [ACIONA_10].
